        Notes for this page: Header -- then a brief description of what the
        website offers and the use of website. Then, maybe list the gems next,
        or do an -about me- section and show off some of the favorite work
        Dimitri has created. Also debating just making the about me page a
        separate page and putting it in the navbar.
